# FearOfOblivion.EfCoreDemo

This repo contains the code for my blog post about cleaning up EF mappings to make the database layout shine through less in the code we write.

The `main` branch contains the initial code. The `clean` branch contains a cleaned up version. And the `clean-5` contains a cleaned up version using EF Core 5 to get around the need for an extra class for many to many relationships.
